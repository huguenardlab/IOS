# IOS
Intrinsic Optical Imaging
This is code developed in MATLAB after extensive discussions and a visit to Dan Feldman's lab at UC Berkeley
There are two parts, the first is a calibration program that is used to calculate the gain factor for each piezo device.  
The second is a real time IOS collection routine.
