# IOS
Intrinsic Optical Imaging
This is code developed in MATLAB after extensive discussions and a visit to Dan Feldman's lab at UC Berkeley
There are three parts. 
- The first is a calibration program calibratePiezo.mthat is used to calculate the gain factor for each piezo device.  
- The second is a live image routine (liveImage.m) handy for focusing on surface blood vessels with green illumination
- The third is a real time IOS collection routine, RecordIOS.m
